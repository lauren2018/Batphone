This repository actually includes several projects:

* ""simpleUI"" is the GUI for the Batphone app.
* ""SensorCapture"" is the GUI for the app I used for the experiments in Chapter 5 of 
[my PhD thesis](http://stevetarzia.com/papers/NWU-EECS-11-09.pdf).  SensorCapture
captures a stream of acoustic fingerprints, wi-fi fingerprints, and photographs.
* ""Fingerprinter"" contains the classes which calculate an Acoustic Background Spectrum;
these are used by both Batphone and SensorCapture.

Some of the commit messages in this repository are
misleading because they refer to files which were stripped out of
the repository prior to posting it publicly.
